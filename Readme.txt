Store Management System (SMS)

==============================

Overview:
The Store Management System (SMS) is a C++ application that facilitates the management of inventory and operations in a store. It provides essential features such as adding new items, displaying items, checking item details, updating item information, deleting items, and performing item sales.

Features:
Add Item: Add new items to the store inventory, including item code, name, company, and quantity.

Display Items: View a list of all items in the store inventory, showing item details such as code, name, company, and quantity.

Check Item: Search for a specific item using its item code to view its details, including name, company, and quantity.

Update Item: Modify the details of an existing item, including its name, company, and quantity.

Delete Item: Remove an item from the store inventory using its item code.

Sell Item: Perform item sales and automatically update the quantity of the sold item in the inventory.

Usage:
Launch the program and select the desired operation from the control panel.

Follow the on-screen instructions to input the necessary information for each operation.

For adding, updating, and deleting items, provide the item code as a unique identifier.

To check a specific item, enter its item code to display its details.

Selling an item will deduct the quantity from the inventory.

Note:
The program utilizes a text file ("item.txt") to store item information. Ensure the file is present in the correct location with appropriate read/write permissions.

The program requires a C++ compiler to compile and run.
